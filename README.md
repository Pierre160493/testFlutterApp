# What is OpenGoalZ ?

OpenGoalZ is an open-source game of football manager highly inspired by Hattrick.

The goal is to have a more dynamic gameplay (Hattrick doesn't changes so much) and to have an active community developing the game so that it gets to choose where the game should go


# Developing

The game is developed as a Flutter (App, Ios and Website) using FireBase as its database and implementing Python functions to interact with it.

## Future ideas

- Multiple univers with different speed
  - normal 7x: one year RL = one year in game
  - speed 28x:

- Radar charts for players stats

- possibility to be a player, same as a normal player but you cant be injured and start strong at 15 years and 0 days (either perfect or you choose where to allocate points)

- Try to hide as much as possible the real stats of player and trainer can be: optimistic or pessimistic, thus will result in positive or negative over estimating error (financial services to decrease this error)

- financing multiple services:
 - young team scanners with possibility of poaching other trams young players
 - medical facilities
 - supporters influence
 - media influence
